  <h3><strong>About ATLAS Youth and Community Hub Leicester</strong></h3>
  <p>Atlas Community Amateur Boxing Club was established in 2018 as a result of requests from the local community.
    During the course of four years, the club runs daily boxing sessions, accommodating all abilities, ages and needs.
    We are England Boxing affiliated and work closely with women and girls, directly increasing the level of female
    participation in boxing. The club has grown over the course of four years attracting over a 100 members from all backgrounds.
    The Club is now looking to develop its programme by encouraging new and more frequent visitors by creating quality sustainable
    youth and community services and activities from a Youth and Community Hub. Construction work via an apprenticeship scheme
    was put on hold prior to Covid on a new building acquired by Atlas ABC.
    This premise, once complete, is a key asset in providing the community with a Youth Hub.</p>
